Data in the release are drawn from a more comprehensive data set published in the Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining, Trade, and Selected Service Industries – First Quarter 2020 (QFR/20-Q1). This quarterly publication is available for downloading at our QFR internet website. The quarterly publication includes summary statements of income and retained earnings, balance sheets, and related financial and operating ratios for manufacturing, mining, trade, and selected service industries.

<p>Reliability of the Estimates Estimates of change presented in this press release are calculated using unrounded data. The calculated difference is then rounded to the nearest unit of measure. Due to this rounding, differences may not add to the totals. The same applies to the calculated confidence intervals. A difference of $0.0 billion indicates the difference is less than $0.05 billion. A confidence interval of ±0.0 billion indicates a confidence interval with width of less then ±0.05 billion on each side of the estimated value.</p>
<p>Data in this press release are based on quarterly financial reports from approximately 8,000 U.S. corporations. The data are estimated from a sample survey and are subject to sampling and nonsampling errors.</p>
<p>Sampling error occurs because only a subset of the entire population is measured. Estimates of sampling error can be computed based on the sample and used to construct confidence intervals around the estimates. Statements of change appearing in this report include 90 percent confidence intervals. Thus, a statement in the report such as “up $2.5 (± 0.2) billion” estimates the interval (+$2.3 billion to +$2.7 billion) within which the actual value is likely to fall in 90 percent of samples of the same size and design, drawn from the same population. If the range of estimated change contains zero (0), then it is uncertain whether there is an increase or decrease; that is, the change is not statistically different from zero (0).</p>
<p>Nonsampling error encompasses all other factors that contribute to the total error of a survey, including response errors, nonresponse, and coverage errors. Although no direct measures of nonsampling error are available, precautionary steps were taken in all phases of the collection, processing, and tabulation of the data in an effort to minimize their influence. The quarterly publication, Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining, Trade, and Selected Service Industries – First Quarter 2020 (QFR/20-Q1), includes more detailed explanations of nonsampling and sampling error, and additional measures of sampling variability. Explanations of confidence intervals and sampling variability can be found on our website at <www.census.gov/econ/qfr/documents/QFR_Methodology.pdf>.</p>
<p>Data Quality Indicators The QFR produces two indicators of data quality: the Unit Response Rate and the Total Quantity Response Rate. The URR is defined as the percentage of sampled units (unweighted) that responded to the current quarter’s survey. In determining the URR, a unit is classified as a respondent if it provided adequate information for key QFR data items. The TQRR is defined as the proportion of the weighted estimated total of a key QFR data item that is either reported by a survey unit or acquired from some other information source (such as a publically available quarterly or annual report) and that is determined to be</p>

<p>equivalent in quality to reported data. The absolute value is applied to the real-valued data item Income before Income taxes, (|NIBT|), prior to calculating the weighted estimated total. The TQRR is calculated for the QFR data items Net sales, Depreciation, |NIBT|, and Total assets.</p>

- **Background**: This course originally created for developers teaches the principles and tactics to use to control ChatGPT, i.e. lead it through a natural language instruction to write text that meets your expectations. However, since it's basically learning to talk to ChatGPT and it's possible to do it without any code (i.e. in a web interface), it seemed to me that everyone could benefit from this course. Thus, I decided to summarize each of its chapters and list the key points put forward by the trainers Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI). In addition to English speakers, I have also decided to facilitate its access to French and Portuguese speakers with versions translated into their respective languages.
- **Realization**: So, how to do all this as quickly as possible? Of course, I worked with an assistant... by the name of [ChatGPT 4](https://openai.com/gpt-4). Using my personal account on OpenAI, I asked ChatGPT to summarize the text transcripts of each of the videos in the course, to extract the key points in the form of a list, then translate their textual answers (the instructions used can be found in the appendix). I then did a proofreading of the texts and possibly made some alterations when I deemed it necessary (nothing essential). Finally, I integrated all texts into github.
- **Note**: The text transcripts and notebooks are made available via links to allow everyone to source the information on this page and facilitate their implementation. However, you must register on the course page to watch the videos.
